# DM Playground (React Rebuild)

Client-only React rebuild scaffold for DM Playground. This project is the starting point for porting the Angular implementation to idiomatic React with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Scripts

- npm run dev
- npm run build
- npm run preview
- npm run lint

## Notes

- Panel layout, services, and workers are placeholders and will be implemented incrementally.
- Public VM assets and BYOND tooling will be added in future steps.
